    <b><h1>ABOUT GENDER EQUALITY</b></h1>
    <p> Gender equality, besides being a fundamental human right, is essential to achieve peaceful societies, with full human potential and sustainable development. Moreover, it has been shown that empowering women spurs productivity and economic growth.Gender equality requires equal enjoyment by women and men of socially-valued goods, opportunities, resources and rewards. Where gender inequality exists, it is generally women who are excluded or disadvantaged in relation to decision-making and access to economic and social resources.Gender equality is a goal in itself and a prerequisite for sustainable and peaceful development. Gender equality is achieved when women, men, girls and boys have equal rights, conditions and opportunities, and the power to shape their own lives and contribute to the development of society.<br>Gender Equality was made part of international human rights law by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948.</P>

<p>Women and girls represent half of the world‟s population and, therefore, also half of its
potential. Gender equality, besides being a fundamental human right, is essential to achieve
peaceful societies, with full human potential and sustainable development. Moreover, it has been
shown that empowering women spurs productivity and economic growth.
Unfortunately, there is still a long way to go to achieve full equality of rights and
opportunities between men and women. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to end the
multiple forms of gender violence and secure equal access to quality education and health,
economic resources and participation in political life for both women and girls and men and boys.
It is also essential to achieve equal opportunities in access to employment and to positions of
leadership and decision-making at all levels.<br></p>

<p><b>Gender equality and human rights:</b><br>

The landmark Declaration, adopted by the General Assembly on 10 December 1948,
reaffirms that “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” and that “everyone
is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, … birth or other status.”
As the international feminist movement began to gain momentum during the 1970s, the
General Assembly declared 1975 as the International Women‟s Year and organized the first World
Conference on Women, held in Mexico City. At the urging of the Conference, it subsequently
declared the years 1976-1985 as the UN Decade for Women and established a Voluntary Fund for
Decade.
In 1979, the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which is often described as an International Bill of
Rights for Women. In its 30 articles, the Convention explicitly defines discrimination against
women and sets up an agenda for national action to end such discrimination. The Convention
targets culture and tradition as influential forces shaping gender roles and family relations, and it is
the first human rights treaty to affirm the reproductive rights of women.</p>

<p><b>Gender Budgeting:</b><br>

Women and girls face various forms of vulnerability throughout the life cycle. They may
face discrimination before or after birth; violence, harassment or abuse; neglect due to dependence
and lack of access to resources; social prejudice; and exploitation – whether economic, political,
social or religious. They are vulnerable to exploitation and discrimination regardless of where they
are positioned on the economic and social spectrum. Gender Budgeting is a tool that can be used to
address these vulnerabilities.<br>

Gender Equality is a very important thing needed for the development of a country. Gender equality has been convincingly appeared to invigorate economic growth, which is crucial for low-income countries. Gender equality among women and men alludes to the equivalent rights, obligations and open doors for women and men and boys and girls. Fairness doesn't imply that women and men will become same however that woman and man's privileges, duties and openings won't rely upon whether they are brought into the world male or female. Gender equality implies that the interests, needs and priorities of both women and men are taken into consideration recognizing the diversity of different groups of women and men. This paper clearly brings out the concept of gender equality in SDGs and provoking its importance in the well-being of a country.</p>
